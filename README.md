# Sorting Visualizer
I built this project to solidify my understand for sorting algorithms. At the same time, I wanted to learn how to develop a React app, so I decided it would be awesome to build a visualizer that others can also use.  

Below, you can read about how the algorithms work and their time complexities. Cheers!

# Time Complexities of these algorithms
Sorting algorithms are algorithms that sort a list of elements (numbers, names, anything, literally). For this sorting visualizer, the application sorts the array from least to greatest value. 

Note: space DOES NOT affect time complexity. For example, if I had an array [6], then one could say the time complexity is O(1). But n = 1, so the time complexity is also O(n) with that logic. Don't be fooled!

## Insertion Sort
Time Complexities
* Worst Case: O(n^2)
* Average Case: O(n^2)
* Best Case: O(n)

to be updated

## Selection Sort
Time Complexities
* Worst Case: O(n^2)
* Average Case: O(n^2)
* Best Case: O(n^2)

to be updated

## Merge Sort
Time Complexities
* Worst Case: O(nlog(n))
* Average Case: O(nlog(n))
* Best Case: O(nlog(n))

to be updated

## Quick Sort
Time Complexities
* Worst Case: O(n^2)
* Average Case: O(nlog(n))
* Best Case: O(nlog(n))

to be updated

## Future adjustments
* update readme.file some day (accidentally deleted the file and way too lazy to write it again)-: )
* user adjusts array size
* displaying the index location
* disabling hover effect while algorithm is running

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
